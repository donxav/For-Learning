Word Guessing Game 🎯

Welcome to my Word Guessing Game project! I'm currently learning Python, and this is my first project where I built a simple command-line game.

In this game, the player has to guess a word letter by letter. It's similar to the classic game "Hangman" but without the hangman part. 🎮
How to Play 🕹️

    The game picks a random word.
    You need to guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
    You have a limited number of wrong guesses—so choose wisely!
    The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of guesses.

How to Run the Game 🚀

    Clone the repository:
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/word-guessing-game.git

    cd word-guessing-game

Run the Python script:

bash

    python3 word_guess.py

What I’m Learning 🧠

    Basics of Python syntax and structure.
    Control flow with loops and conditionals.
    Handling user input and displaying output.
    Working with randomness and strings in Python.
