# Word Guesser Game

This is a **simple Python-based word guessing game** where players try to guess a random word letter by letter. The game selects words from a predefined list stored in a file and offers the player a limited number of attempts to guess the word.

## Features
- **Random Word Selection**: The game picks a random word from a list of words stored in a text file (`words.txt`).
- **Interactive Gameplay**: The player guesses the word letter by letter.
- **Attempts Limitation**: The player has 10 attempts to guess the word correctly before the game ends.

## Motivation
Hi! I'm a **new learner** in the world of Python programming. This project is part of my learning journey, and I’m excited to explore more of what Python can do. My goal is to create fun, simple projects that help me improve my coding skills and understanding of programming concepts.

### What I've learned:
- **File Handling**: Reading from and processing text files.
- **Random Module**: Selecting random items from a list.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Using `while` loops, `if` statements, and updating game state based on user input.
- **String Manipulation**: Working with strings and lists to dynamically update the guessed word.

I hope to build more projects like this to continue improving my Python skills!

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-guesser.git

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd For-Learning

### 3. Ensure you have Python installed:

This project requires Python 3.6 or later. You can check your Python version by running:

python --version

### 4. Add or Modify Word List:

The game uses a word list from words.txt file. You can update this file with your own words or use the provided words.

### 5. Run the Game:

python word_guesser.py

### How the Game Works:

The game will randomly choose a word from words.txt.
You have 10 attempts to guess the word.
Input one letter at a time, and the game will reveal correct guesses.
If you guess all the letters before running out of attempts, you win!

### Future Improvements and Plans

Since I am still learning, I have some ideas for future versions:

    Improved User Interface: Create a graphical version of the game using Tkinter or another library.
    More Game Modes: Add difficulty levels, such as harder words, or limiting the number of incorrect guesses.
    Leaderboard: Keep track of scores and store them in a file or database.

I’m eager to expand on this project and take on more advanced challenges as I progress with Python.
