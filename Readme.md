Python Projects for Learning 🐍

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my collection of Python projects. I'm learning Python and experimenting with different ideas to sharpen my skills. This repository is a mix of small projects, scripts, and exercises that I've built as I explore the language.

It's not super structured or formal—just a space for me to code and learn. I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on my progress. If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to jump in!
What's in This Repo? 🛠️

You'll find a random assortment of Python scripts and mini-projects here. I'm trying to learn through building, so these projects cover a mix of topics and levels. They might not be perfect, but hey, that’s part of the journey!

Current Projects:
    
- Guess the Word 🎲: A simple word guessing game.

    

How to Run These Projects 🚀
  Clone this repo:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-projects.git
     
 cd For-Learning

Pick a project folder and navigate to it:
cd project-folder-name

Run the Python script for the project:
    python3 script_name.py

What I'm Hoping to Learn 🧠
- Getting more comfortable with Python syntax and libraries.
- Building small, working projects from scratch.
- Learning how to handle user input and interact with external data (like APIs).
- Developing basic skills with control flow and data structures.
- Exploring beginner-level OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).

Got Feedback? 💬

If you're checking out this repo and have some feedback or ideas, I'd love to hear them! Open an issue or submit a pull request if you want to suggest something.

Since I'm still learning, I would greatly appreciate any constructive criticism or tips.

Future Plans 🛠️
Here are some things I might add as I keep learning:      
- Weather CLI: A command-line tool to fetch the current weather for a given city using an API.
- A basic web app using Flask or Django. 
- Some fun with data science using pandas or matplotlib.
- More advanced game mechanics for the word Guesser.

Stay tuned!

Thanks for stopping by!
